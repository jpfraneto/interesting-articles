http://paulgraham.com/lesson.html About how the educational system has told us to hack the test more than to learn the subject of what the test is about. 
It is something that is deeply embeded in how we work, and turning this thing around is going to be very beneficial in order to have success as an entrepreneur,
since the challenges there are not hackable, because they generate themselves as time goes by. There is no way to know what is going to happen in one year, 
so the best that I can do is to prepare myself for the unknown. And that is not learning how to hack the test, it is learning how to learn and develop evolving
skills.
